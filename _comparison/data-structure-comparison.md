Here is a list of comparison between different data structures:

| Data structure | Time complexity (worst) | Time complexity (average) | Space complexity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Array | O(1) | O(1) | O(n) |
| Linked list | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) |
| Stack | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) |
| Queue | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) |
| Hash table | O(n) | O(1) | O(n) |
| Binary search tree | O(n) | O(logn) | O(n) |
| Red-black tree | O(logn) | O(logn) | O(n) |
| AVL tree | O(logn) | O(logn) | O(n) |
| Splay tree | O(n) | O(logn) | O(n) |
| Trie | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) |
| Fenwick tree | O(nlogn) | O(nlogn) | O(n) |
| Segment tree | O(n) | O(logn) | O(n) |

-   Time complexity: The time complexity of an operation on a data structure is a measure of the amount of time it takes to perform the operation as a function of the size of the input. In the case of data structures, the time complexity is usually expressed as a function of the number of elements in the structure.

-   Space complexity: The space complexity of a data structure is a measure of the amount of memory it uses as a function of the size of the input. In the case of data structures, the space complexity is usually expressed as a function of the number of elements in the structure.
