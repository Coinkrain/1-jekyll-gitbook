Here is a comparison of merge sort and quick sort in table form:

| Property | Merge Sort | Quick Sort |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Time complexity (worst) | O(n * logn) | O(n^2) |
| Time complexity (average) | O(n * logn) | O(n * logn) |
| Space complexity | O(n) | O(logn) |
| Stable | Yes | No |
| In-place | No | Yes |
