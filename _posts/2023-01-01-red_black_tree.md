A red-black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. It is a data structure that allows you to store a sorted list of items efficiently, while maintaining the balance of the tree so that searches, insertions, and deletions can be performed in O(log n) time.

In JavaScript, you can implement a red-black tree by creating a class or a constructor function that represents a node in the tree. Each node can have up to two children, with the left child representing a node with a smaller value and the right child representing a node with a larger value. Each node also has a color, which can be either red or black. You can then use this node class to build the red-black tree by adding nodes for each item and maintaining the balance of the tree using rotations and color changes.

Here is an example of a simple red-black tree class in JavaScript:
