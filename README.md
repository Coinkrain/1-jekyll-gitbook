JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to build web applications. It has a rich set of built-in features and libraries, and is also well-suited for implementing various algorithms and data structures.

Here is a list of some common algorithms and data structures that can be implemented in JavaScript:

### Algorithms:

 - `Sorting algorithms`: quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, bubblesort, selectionsort
 - `Search algorithms`: binary search, linear search, depth-first search, breadth-first search
 - `Graph algorithms`: dijkstra's algorithm, prim's algorithm, kruskal's algorithm
 - `Other algorithms`: knapsack problem, traveling salesman problem, maximum subarray problem

### Data structures:

 - `Arrays`: a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements
 - `Linked lists`: a data structure that consists of a set of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list
 - `Stacks`: a data structure that follows the last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle, allowing you to push and pop elements from the top of the stack
 - `Queues`: a data structure that follows the first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle, allowing you to enqueue and dequeue elements from the front and back of the queue
 - `Trees`: a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes in a parent-child relationship, with a root node at the top and leaf nodes at the bottom
 - `Graphs`: a non-linear data structure that consists of vertices (or nodes) and edges, representing relationships between the nodes
